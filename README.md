********Iteration 2**********
Use the Iteration2 branch.

Django has to be installed and working on the computer you're using.

To get the server to run on your local machine, make sure you are running the powershell/terminal wherever you cloned the files on your machine and type in:

python manage.py runserver

NOTE: Make sure you are in the directory where manage.py is in!!!!

NOTE: You might have to do python3 manage.py runserver

Then go to the web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ama/

After getting to the landing page, you can navigate to another page and navigate throughout the web app from there by clicking around and seeing the functionality that we have implemented.
