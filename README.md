********Iteration 1**********
ReadMe for initialization

Use the IterationOne branch.

Django has to be installed and working on the computer you're using.

To get the server to run on your local machine, make sure you are running the powershell/terminal wherever you cloned the files on your machine and type in:

python manage.py runserver

NOTE: Make sure you are in the directory where manage.py is in!!!!

NOTE: You might have to do python3 manage.py runserver

Then go to the web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ama/

After getting to the landing page, you can navigate to another page and navigate throughout the web app from there by clicking the buttons at the top of the page. The only page with anything to it is the Calendar Page. You can go to "Add Event" and type into the text boxes, but you cannot actually create an event yet. 

MembersList.py - To test just make sure you run the module. Unit test should execute first displaying information
