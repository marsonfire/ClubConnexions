ReadMe for initialization

To get the server to run on your local machine, make sure you are running the powershell/terminal wherever you're storing the files on your machine and type in:

python manage.py runserver

NOTE: You might have to do python3 manage.py runserver

Then go to the web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ama/

I've done a lot of restarting and redesign since I was thinking of it incorrectly, but I think this is how it'll be now.
